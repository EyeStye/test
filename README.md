# test

Welcome to my first project😊. This will keep receiving updates. Currently it is **version 0.5**.<br/>
[View it by clicking me](https://eyestye.github.io/test)

## Version 0.0

**_Pre-released_** and very basic. Enter date, month and year of birth in 3 _different_ prompts and calculate age (from a _fixed_ date), it does not account for leap year and takes 1 month as 30 days.

## Version 0.5

- Enter the date of birth in a **single** prompt.
- Now the calculator calculates from today's date (UTC+0)
- It displays singular and plural words accordingly (like using year for years when it is 1, etc.)
- See the message when you enter today's date as date of birth!

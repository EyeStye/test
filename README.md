Welcome to my first projectðŸ˜Š. This will keep receiving updates. Currently it is **version 1.0**.<br/>
[View it by clicking me](https://eyestye.github.io/test)

## Version 0.0

**_Pre-released_** and very basic. Enter date, month and year of birth in 3 _different_ prompts and calculate age (from a _fixed_ date), it does not account for leap year and takes 1 month as 30 days.

## Version 0.5

- Enter the date of birth in a **single** prompt.
- Now the calculator calculates from today's date (UTC+0)
- It displays singular and plural words accordingly (like using year for years when it is 1, etc.)
- See the message when you enter today's date as date of birth!

## Version 1.0

- New, revamped UI
- Enter date in **calendar** format in page itself, rather than typing in prompt
- See the result on page instead of popup

## Version 1.1

- Some more changes to visual appearance
- Bigger font, buttons
